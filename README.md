Embark on a seamless journey into the world of NFTs as I guide you through our innovative development process. To kick things off, the development environment is meticulously set up, and all essential dependencies are downloaded, utilizing a tech stack that includes Hardhat, Alchemy, Pinata, React, and Ethers.js. Leveraging the power of the openzepellin library's ERC721 smart contract, we ingeniously inherit it to craft our unique NFT smart contract named Collection.sol. Once the solidity part is perfected, ethers.js is employed to deploy our smart contract, ensuring transparency and verification on etherscan.Transitioning smoothly to the frontend, I design a simple and intuitive React webpage for our platform. This webpage seamlessly lists five distinct NFTs, setting the stage for users to engage in a personalized minting experience. Users can effortlessly connect to their MetaMask wallets and choose any two NFTs from the collection to call their own. With this straightforward process, your unique NFTs are now ready to be enjoyed and showcased in your MetaMask wallet. Your journey into the realm of digital ownership begins here.

Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the 
build for the best performance.



The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
